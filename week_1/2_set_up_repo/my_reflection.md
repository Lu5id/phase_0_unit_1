## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

* Opening a repo on GitHub is a simple process. To begin, go to your profile on GitHubs website. On the top of the page there are 3 main tabs, the middle one being "Repositories", click this. Inside this tab there is a big green button that says "Create New". Click that button to create a new repo, and on that page you can name it what you want, add a description, and toggle the settings for that folder. Once created, you can now open your GitHub client. Once you login, go to your Username on the left hand side underneath the header "GitHub", if you refresh that page your newly created git will be in there. Once you select it right click and select "Clone". This will create a local version of the file for you to access at any point.
* Open source is pushing software out that anyone can see and edit. If a company creates a software instead of keeping the code private, they can make the code public so that users all over the world can alter or play with it in ways the creators hadn't thought of.
* I love open source. Personally open source has its largest impact for me on the video game industry. A notable open source software that spawned a massive amount of offshoot games was the Half-Life code. Using that code all sorts of shoot-off games were created and I think is a massive reason for innovation in that field. It feels like utopia, or at least an ideal situation, that minds from all over the world can contribute to this code that otherwise would never reach its full capabilities.
* Licenses are there to protect property rights. Without licenses business would be completely unregulated which is not ideal. The problem I have is when a bureaucracy is in charge of ordaining who can and cannot have a license.
* GitHub has been farily confusing, and working with it more on this excercise has definitely helped me out.
