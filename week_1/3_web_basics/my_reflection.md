After spending the whole day stressing about being behind on work for University and DBC, and spending the last few hours slowly working through material I'm behind on this one was gratifying. At first when I tried to load my website it returned a 404 error (the first real snag I've had up to this point). After playing around, altering my initial code and resyncing I got to see my site. 

This was kind've my mindset going into this, that the tasks would be challenging but extremely rewarding when completed, like solving a hard math equation. I'm excited to start this program for real and really hit the ground running.
