## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
the distinction between div class and div id is still confusing to me. From reading around I understand that class trumps id, but It'd be very helpful for me to see that in the code and how tinkering with it affects the layout of the webpage.
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
I don't feel as if i have a circumspect view of HTML yet to answer this question. On the surface I think the separation of stylesheet and code seems really good. On that same token though creating stylesheets seems unnecessarily troublesome.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
As this is my first time really doing anything with HTML this entire challenge felt like an AHA moment. When I realized you could view the code for stylesheets I was like HAHAHAHEYAYEYAFHDUHFEKH!OH!I!!!!!!
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Nope.
