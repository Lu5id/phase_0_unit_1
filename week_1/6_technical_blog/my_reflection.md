## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: <!-- Blog URL here (remove comment)  -->

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I like writing the blog posts. I think in hindsight I'll be really happy I have this folder full of my process through Phase 0. No comments or views as of yet. STYLESHEETS ARE SO HARD!!!
