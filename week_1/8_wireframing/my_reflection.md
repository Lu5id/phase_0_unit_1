## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
I like the idea of designing a website on paper before starting. It's much easier to put your plans into action with a plan on paper.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I did enjoy making the websites this week. I'm still struggling with stylesheets.

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  

After completing the previous challenges this one was fairly straight-forward.
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
STYLESHEETS!!!
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
Not this time.
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
Confident.
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
Drawing the layouts for my favorite sites.
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Nothing for this one.
