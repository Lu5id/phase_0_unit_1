##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector?

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page?  (Surprisingly, it's not just black!)
  * Tweak the background color to white.
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px.
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead.
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/
  * Upload your own image to the imgs directory in the `1_Chrome_Dev_Tools` directory.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.)

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain.

I'm not entirely sure. In the sytle sheet they have the background URL as the image on the page. So it would make sense that they couldn't change the font color on the image. What doesn't make sense to me is that they have a <p>with the text inside of it. Surely if you just put the image in, you wouldn't need to write that into the HTML?

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website?

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the easiest thing to change to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?

Compressing the image files is the easiest way to optimize the website. According to PageSped Insights you can create a 40% reduction by reducing images. Reducing their size by 900KiB.
