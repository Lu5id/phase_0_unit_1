# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM allows us to update our webpages dynamically using primarily JavaScript but other languages as well. It allows us to interact with our webpages. To be honest, right now very little makes sense about it for me. 
I think it will take a good amount of usage to find out exactly how it works, reading all the content online about what a DOM is doesn't really fill my questions. What made sense is the idea of a tree and nodes on the tree, that using this format allows for cross broswer compatability and is the default bluepring used by the DOM. The DOM seems limited by the changes in technology, and requires constant updating so it can be formatted to different devices.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
Chrome Web Tools seemed like it lends itself much better towards actually customizing a site that you want. Wordpress seems like quite an effort to make a site look like its not a wordpress format, if that makes sense.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
Pretty painful to work with. As I keep going though, it's easy to tell that it will be alot better to work with for quick fixes to webpages, or quick designs.
Using the interface is a pain

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
Mhhhh, not particularly, it will take more time working with the Tools
to get those "aha" moments

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No, googling around for help wasn't particularly helpful for this.
