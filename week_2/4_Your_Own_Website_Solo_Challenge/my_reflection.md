My Website url: Lu5id.github.io

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

Really not a fan of HTML. I feel like im jerry rigging things along the way and kind've shortcutting. Especially when it comes to positioning on my web page it's a chore.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
positioning elements on my page took a long time

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I would like to make it so if i fix the banner at the top My picture that i put on there doesn't overlap it.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
Everything applied is pretty challenging with my 0 background at the moment. Again, when things DO work, its extremely rewarding.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.'
nope'
