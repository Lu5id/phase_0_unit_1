# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

Not getting bogged down on one thing. My first week I think I spent like 10 hours on the first webpage and it wasn't at all conducive to my success. I had a lot better go at it after taking a short break and coming back to it.

* How will you combat that? 
Set a better time frame in which to do my work. And ration reasonable breaks throughout it.

* What techniques will you try?
Being organized... for once.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
I thought after just coming home for the first time in a year I'd have a little more time to plant my roots and get back into the swing of home life before phase 0. I now realize that on top of my other work schedules, I'm going to have to devote a LOT more time to my phase 0 success.
