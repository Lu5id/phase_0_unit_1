The prospect of failure scares the hell out of me. Failures not something I'm used to, I've been extremely "lucky" all my life being successful at most everything I've tried my hand at. I've always been a believer in the dogma that, "things will work out" and up to this point that's held true. It isn't until I've started working through the course work that some of my beliefs may have been shaken.

I've always been the kind of person that's skated by in school, I've always gotten decent grades, and gone to good schools with minimum effort. This is the point in my life I've realized I need to commit to something fully, and the prospect of failure is daunting, I've invested heavily into the success of this program and failing would be the worst case of events for me.

My biggest fear is having a 9-5 job. I started my own small business in college and that's all I want to do, my dream is to micromanage multiple small business by the time I'm 30, the idea of being my own boss consumes me. While I had a good amount of success, I realized that working in the food service industry, or a cleaning service or whatever kind've traditional startup business could be achieved by anyone. And when I think of the 'modern day entrepreneur' I think of someone in the tech industry. My hope is that I can complete this course, and gain some insight into the industry that I can use towards my own ends. Failing at DBC would mean an incredible setback in fulfilling my own personal aspirations.
